Black box identification is a method to identify a mathematical model of a system which, in some cases, can't be modeled by another method. The height control of an object inside a wind tunnel is one of these cases. This undergraduate thesis studies the least squares and subspace identification of a wind tunnel in order to apply state feedback control.
